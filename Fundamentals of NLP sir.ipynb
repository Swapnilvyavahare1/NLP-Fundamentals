    "my_paragraph = \"READ LATER Statecraft involves management of competing demands for accommodation and inclusion, without unduly affecting the interests of any section of society. However, some rulers, such as those in Karnataka, want to be seen as discriminating against a minority group in the hope of garnering the support of the majority. The Karnataka government’s decision to scrap the 4% quota for Muslims within the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category and earmark an additional 2% each to the dominant Vokkaliga and Veerashaiva-Lingayat communities is a divisive gamble in the expectation of electoral dividends. The BJP regime has also created four sub-categories to introduce internal reservation for different Dalit communities under the Scheduled Caste (SC) category. The scrapping of reservation for Muslims, whose poorer members will now have to compete with the general category for the 10% ‘Economically Weaker Sections’ quota, is reminiscent of the abrogation of the 5% quota for Muslims in Maharashtra in 2015. While reservation on the basis of religion alone is untenable, it appears that there has been no recommendation from the Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission for the withdrawal of reservation benefits for Muslims. The BJP has sought to portray the introduction of reservation for Muslims in 1995 as an instance of minority appeasement.It is indeed true that the Constitution does not allow reservation on the basis of religion alone, and that there have been judicial verdicts striking down quotas for Muslims for not being backed by a proper study on the extent of backwardness in the community. However, it is possible to extend reservation benefits to the backward sections among religious minorities identified on the basis of relevant criteria. Some States have been implementing reservation in educational institutions as well as public employment for Muslims by including them in the Backward Classes (BC) list. It is futile to argue that large sections of Muslims have reached a level of social and educational advancement that will justify their exclusion from the BC category, or that they are not under-represented in the services. While Muslim leaders and organisations have opposed the scrapping of the reservation, the categorisation of the SC communities is also controversial. Sections of Dalits are up in arms against the reordering of the 17% SC quota among different groups. Major decisions, such as changing the reservation policy, in the run-up to elections are not merely suspect, but may end up stoking unwanted fires\""

       "'the characters in jonathan lynn \\' s \" the whole nine yards , \" yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies ( 1999 \\' s \" analyze this \" and \" mickey blue eyes , \" 2000 \\' s \" gun shy \" ) , are rarely ever written as real people , but merely as one - dimensional caricatures . when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed , it is not to service the character development , or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations , but to accommodate the convoluted plot . in a lightweight comedy , you might say , it is not required to have perfectly realized figures , just as long as they get the job done . unfortunately , for a comedy to work , it has to at least succeed at being funny , and if there was a laugh - o - meter available , i \\' d guess that it briefly ascended around 2 . 5 % of the time for me . suffice to say , the comedy in \" the whole nine yards \" works about as well as the broken - down lawnmower in my backyard , and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes , it is by sheer luck . nicholas \" oz \" oseransky ( matthew perry ) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec . trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie ( rosanna arquette , delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french - canadian accent ) , one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next - door . walking over to greet him , he is horrified to discover it is jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski ( bruce willis ) , a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison . once getting to know him and becoming his friend , oz is more comfortable with his identity , but for sophie , it means a possible hitman to do away with oz . in her scheme , sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss ( kevin pollak ) about jimmy \\' s whereabouts , but in the process , he falls in love with jimmy \\' s wife , cynthia ( natasha henstridge ) , who is being held hostage . upon return to quebec , and with one contrivance after the next , oz \\' s dental assistant , jill ( amanda peet ) , is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside \" the tulip , \" and forces him to set up a meeting , since jill \\' s dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself . have you got all that ? because there is more . much , much more . and this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour . \" the whole nine yards \" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty - headed excursion into well - worn terrain already set by far superior pictures . how the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn \\' s 1985 comedy classic , \" clue : the movie . \" going into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty - minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble . since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing \" comedy \" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value . \" the whole nine yards \" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill \\' s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark . a few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all . on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis . perry , innocuously enjoyable on tv \\' s \" friends , \" plays the same exact sitcom - style character in all of his movies ( from 1997 \\' s \" fools rush in \" to 1999 \\' s \" three to tango \" ) , and it has become a crushing bore . meanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background . their three female counterparts fare noticeably better . best of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative \" species \" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia . henstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent . amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy . it is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts . finally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time . also popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in \" the green mile , \" as jimmy \\' s largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs . when \" the whole nine yards \" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit . a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ? without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments , \" the whole nine yards \" rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast , and half of the actors are not charming at all . now , what does that tell you ?'"

      "\n",
      "Scikit-Learn’s API is remarkably well designed. The main design principles are:17\n",
      "\n",
      "• Consistency. All objects share a consistent and simple interface:\n",
      "\n",
      "— Estimators. Any object that can estimate some parameters based on a dataset\n",
      "is called an estimator (e.g., an imputer is an estimator). The estimation itself is\n",
      "performed by the fit() method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or\n",
      "two  for  supervised  learning  algorithms;  the  second  dataset  contains  the\n",
      "labels).  Any  other  parameter  needed  to  guide  the  estimation  process  is  con‐\n",
      "sidered a hyperparameter (such as an imputer’s strategy), and it must be set\n",
      "as an instance variable (generally via a constructor parameter).\n",
      "\n",
      "— Transformers.  Some  estimators  (such  as  an  imputer)  can  also  transform  a\n",
      "dataset; these are called transformers. Once again, the API is quite simple: the\n",
      "transformation is performed by the transform() method with the dataset to\n",
      "transform as a parameter. It returns the transformed dataset. This transforma‐\n",
      "tion generally relies on the learned parameters, as is the case for an imputer.\n",
      "All  transformers  also  have  a  convenience  method  called  fit_transform() \n",
      "that  is  equivalent  to  calling  fit()  and  then  transform()  (but  sometimes\n",
      "fit_transform() is optimized and runs much faster).\n",
      "\n",
      "— Predictors. Finally, some estimators are capable of making predictions given a\n",
      "dataset; they are called predictors. For example, the LinearRegression model \n",
      "in  the  previous  chapter  was  a  predictor:  it  predicted  life  satisfaction  given  a\n",
      "country’s  GDP  per  capita.  A  predictor  has  a  predict()  method  that  takes  a\n",
      "dataset of new instances and returns a dataset of corresponding predictions. It\n",

      "instance  variables  (e.g.,  imputer.strategy),  and  all  the  estimator’s  learned\n",

      "• If  you  call  any  external  library,  including  NumPy  or  even  the  standard  library,\n",
      "this  call  will  run  only  during  tracing,  it  will  not  be  part  of  the  graph.  Indeed,  a\n",

      "(unless you really want the code to run only during tracing).\n",
      "— For  example,  if  you  define  a  TF  function  f(x)  that  just  returns  np.ran\n",
      "dom.rand(),  a  random  number  will  only  be  generated  when  the  function  is\n",

      "new  random  number  will  be  generated  upon  every  call,  since  the  operation\n",
      "will be part of the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "— If  your  non-TensorFlow  code  has  side-effects  (such  as  logging  something  or\n",
      "updating  a  Python  counter),  then  you  should  not  expect  that  side-effect  to\n",
